Lightweight framework for discovering and initializing node/express modules

This will make more sense once I write some tests and upload the API frameowrk that uses it. I am separating it out so that frameworks based on other forms of back-end data-gathering can use it as well.

**Usage**:

Don't use this yet. I am still working out the details with the first real implementation (an-API based framework that calls everything in parallel and returns HTML or JSON)
